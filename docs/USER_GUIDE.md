## Getting Started

Upon opening Garuda 4.0, you'll see the main dashboard with several sections:

- **Predictor**: Enter food items to see how they might affect menstrual symptoms
- **AI Chat**: Ask questions about nutrition, menstrual health, and food impacts
- **History**: View your previous food impact predictions
- **About**: Learn about the science behind the predictions

You can navigate between these sections using the navigation menu at the top of the page or by scrolling down.

## Food Impact Predictor

The Food Impact Predictor is the core feature of Garuda 4.0.

### How to Use the Predictor

1. Navigate to the "Predictor" section
2. Enter a food name in the input field (e.g., "Spinach", "Dark Chocolate", "Almonds")
3. Click the "Predict" button or press Enter
4. Wait a few seconds while our AI analyzes the food
5. View the results, which include:
   - Food information (category, subcategory, processing level, etc.)
   - Predicted impact on six menstrual symptoms

### Understanding the Results

The impacts are classified into three categories:

- **Beneficial**: This food may help reduce this symptom
- **Harmful**: This food may worsen this symptom
- **Neutral**: This food is unlikely to significantly affect this symptom

Each impact is color-coded for easy understanding:

- Green: Beneficial
- Red: Harmful
- Blue: Neutral

## AI Chatbot

The AI Chatbot allows you to have conversations about nutrition, menstrual health, and more.

### How to Use the Chatbot

1. Navigate to the "AI Chat" section
2. Type your question or message in the input field
3. Press Enter or click the send button
4. Wait for the AI to respond

### Example Questions

- "What foods are good for reducing menstrual cramps?"
- "How does diet affect menstrual health?"
- "Can you explain what glycemic index means?"
- "What foods should I avoid during my period?"
- "How does caffeine affect menstrual symptoms?"

## Prediction History

The History section keeps track of your previous food impact predictions.

### Viewing History

1. Navigate to the "History" section
2. Browse through your recent predictions
3. Each history item shows:
   - Food name
   - Timestamp of prediction
   - Impact predictions for each symptom

You can use this to keep track of foods you've researched and their predicted impacts.

## About the Science

The About section explains the science behind Garuda 4.0's predictions.

### Model Information

Our predictions are based on machine learning models trained on a dataset of food attributes and their observed effects on menstrual symptoms. The system uses:

1. **Multiple ML Algorithms**: We tested several algorithms and selected the best performing one
2. **ROC Curves**: Used to evaluate model performance
3. **AI-Powered Food Analysis**: We use Groq's advanced LLM to analyze food attributes automatically

### Prediction Metrics

The predictions are based on several food attributes:

- Food category and subcategory
- Processing level
- Caffeine content
- Flavor profile
- Common allergens
- Glycemic index
- Inflammatory index
- Calories

## FAQs

### Q: How accurate are the predictions?

A: The predictions are based on a trained ML model and general food attributes. While they provide valuable insights, individual responses to foods can vary. Use these predictions as guidelines rather than absolute truths.

### Q: Can I predict the impact of multiple foods at once?

A: Currently, the system predicts one food at a time. For a meal with multiple ingredients, you can predict each ingredient separately.

### Q: Is my data saved?

A: Yes, your prediction history is saved in a local database to provide you with a history feature. No personal information is required or stored.

### Q: What if the food I enter isn't recognized?

A: Our AI will attempt to analyze any food you enter. If it can't recognize the food or some of its attributes, it will use default values where necessary and inform you.

### Q: How often is the model updated?

A: The model is periodically updated as new data becomes available and as our understanding of food impacts on menstrual health evolves.
